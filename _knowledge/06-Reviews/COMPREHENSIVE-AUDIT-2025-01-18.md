# 3. Clean filesystem
rm .env.local
git log --all --full-history -- .env.local  # Verify no git history
```

**Day 2-3: Critical Security Fixes**
```typescript
// Fix authentication bypass
export async function verifyAuth(authHeader?: string | null): Promise<AuthResult> {
  // Remove development bypass - always use Firebase Admin or fail securely
  if (!adminAuth) {
    return { user: null, error: 'Authentication service unavailable' }
  }
  const decodedToken = await adminAuth.verifyIdToken(token)
  return { user: decodedToken, error: null }
}

// Fix XSS vulnerability
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify'
function markdownToHtml(markdown: string): string {
  const html = markdown.replace(/### (.*?)$/gm, '<h3 class="font-semibold mt-3 mb-1">$1</h3>')
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(html) // Sanitize before returning
}
```

**Day 4-5: Development Velocity Recovery**
```typescript
// 1. Split monolithic components
// Break nodes-client.tsx (1,529 lines) into:
// - NodesList.tsx, NodeFilters.tsx, BulkActions.tsx, NodeModals.tsx

// 2. Downgrade React to stable
npm install react@18.3.1 react-dom@18.3.1

// 3. Remove console pollution
// Use next.config.js build-time stripping (already configured)

// 3. Calendar Domain: calendarStore + scheduleStore + routineStore
// 4. User Domain: authStore + userPreferencesStore
// 5. UI Domain: uiStore
// 6. Integration Domain: xpStore + journalStore

// Operation queuing to prevent race conditions
class OperationQueue {
  private queue: Promise<any> = Promise.resolve()
  async enqueue<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    return this.queue = this.queue.then(operation, operation)
  }
}
```

**Week 4: Testing Foundation**
```typescript

## Conclusion

Brain Space demonstrates **exceptional technical foundations** with sophisticated state management, outstanding accessibility, and production-ready Next.js architecture. However, **critical security vulnerabilities require immediate emergency response** before any deployment.

The codebase is architecturally sound but suffers from classic scaling challenges: component monoliths, store fragmentation, and testing gaps that will significantly impact development velocity if not addressed systematically.

**Immediate Priority**: Security incident response and credential rotation
**Strategic Priority**: Component architecture refactoring and testing foundation
**Long-term Priority**: Performance optimization and real-time collaboration features

With focused effort over the next 30 days addressing the P0 security issues and P1 development velocity blockers, Brain Space will transition from a security-compromised prototype to a scalable, maintainable production application ready for user growth and feature expansion.
