## 🎯 Week 2 Readiness

### Foundation Established
- ✅ Testing infrastructure operational
- ✅ Patterns established for all test types
- ✅ Mock strategies proven
- ✅ CI/CD ready

### Next Priorities (Week 2)
1. **Component Testing** (12 hours)
   - IOSButton, TimeboxCard, Dashboard components
   - Target: 50% component coverage

2. **Real-time Synchronization** (24 hours)
   - Firebase listeners implementation
   - Optimistic updates with rollback
   - Conflict resolution

3. **Performance Optimization** (16 hours)
   - Bundle splitting (<500kB target)
   - Route-level optimization
   - Lazy loading improvements

## 💡 Key Learnings & Insights

### What Worked Well
1. **Parallel test development** - Multiple test suites simultaneously
2. **Mock-first approach** - No external dependencies in tests
3. **Reusable patterns** - Test utilities accelerated development
4. **Separate environments** - API tests in Node, components in jsdom

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Next.js server mocking** - Created custom mock implementation
2. **Dynamic imports** - Handled Next.js dynamic components
3. **Zustand store mocking** - Selector-based mock pattern
4. **Memory issues** - Separated test runs by category

### Recommendations
1. **Continue incremental testing** - Add tests with each feature
2. **Maintain test isolation** - Keep test suites independent
3. **Document patterns** - Update CLAUDE.md with test examples
4. **Monitor coverage** - Track progress toward 80% goal
