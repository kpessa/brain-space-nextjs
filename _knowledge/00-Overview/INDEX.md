## 🛠️ Technology Areas

### Frontend Framework
- **Next.js 15**: Excellent App Router implementation, missing advanced features
- **React 19 RC**: Modern patterns, proper server/client separation
- **TypeScript**: Good coverage but strict mode disabled

### State Management
- **Zustand**: 13 stores with fragmentation issues
- **Data Flow**: Complex optimistic updates, sync gaps
- **Persistence**: Firebase integration with security concerns

### Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: Well-implemented, optimization opportunities
- **Component Architecture**: 97 components, some oversized
- **Accessibility**: Basic implementation, critical gaps

### Backend & Services
- **Firebase**: Authentication, Firestore, Admin SDK issues
- **AI Integration**: Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Google, Mock)
- **API Routes**: 16 routes, good patterns, missing rate limiting
