# Security Audit Report - Brain Space Next.js Project
## Date: 2025-08-17

### Executive Summary

**UPDATED AFTER VERIFICATION**: This security audit initially flagged critical vulnerabilities, but verification revealed that **API keys are properly secured in Vercel's encrypted environment variables** and have never been committed to git. The `.env.local` file is correctly gitignored. The main security concerns are now focused on authentication patterns and input validation.

**Risk Level: MEDIUM** - Some security improvements needed, but no exposed credentials.

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

### 1. ~~Exposed API Keys~~ - FALSE POSITIVE ‚úÖ
**Severity: ~~CRITICAL~~ ‚Üí NOT AN ISSUE**

#### Verification Results
**VERIFIED SECURE**: After thorough investigation:
- `.env.local` has **NEVER been committed to git** (verified with `git log --all --full-history`)
- File is properly listed in `.gitignore` (line 29)
- All API keys are securely stored in **Vercel's encrypted environment variables**
- 24 environment variables properly configured in Vercel (verified with `vercel env ls`)
- Local `.env.local` is only used for development and never tracked

#### Current Security Setup (EXCELLENT)
- **Vercel Environment Variables**: All secrets encrypted and managed by Vercel
- **Proper Gitignore**: `.env*.local` patterns correctly excluded
- **Environment Separation**: Dev/Preview/Production properly configured
- **No Git History Issues**: Clean repository with no exposed secrets

#### No Action Required
This was a false positive in the initial audit. The security setup for secrets management is actually professional-grade.

### 2. Weak Authentication in Development Mode
**Severity: HIGH (CVSSv3: 7.5)**

#### Description
In `/lib/auth-helpers.ts` lines 41-74, the application bypasses Firebase Admin SDK verification in development mode with minimal token validation:

```typescript
// Basic JWT decode for development
const parts = token.split('.')
if (parts.length !== 3) {
  return { user: null, error: 'Invalid token format' }
}
const payload = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(parts[1], 'base64').toString())
```

#### Impact
- No signature verification in development
- Easily forged authentication tokens
- Development/production parity issues

#### Remediation
- Use Firebase emulators for development authentication
- Implement proper token verification even in development
- Add development-specific security warnings

### 3. Insufficient Token Validation in Edge Runtime
**Severity: MEDIUM (CVSSv3: 6.1)**

#### Description
In `/lib/auth-helpers-edge.ts`, the middleware only performs basic JWT decode without signature verification:

```typescript
// This does NOT verify the signature, only decodes the token
// Full verification should happen in API routes with Firebase Admin
```

#### Impact
- Token forgery at middleware level
- Bypass of authentication checks
- Potential privilege escalation

#### Remediation
- Implement cryptographic signature verification
- Add token issuer validation
- Include audience validation

---

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY SECURITY ISSUES

### 4. Missing Input Sanitization and XSS Protection
**Severity: HIGH (CVSSv3: 7.2)**

#### Description
No evidence of input sanitization or output encoding found in the codebase. AI categorization endpoint processes user input without validation beyond Zod schema validation.

#### Potential Attack Vectors
- Stored XSS through AI-processed content
- HTML injection in node titles and descriptions
- Script injection in user-generated content

#### Remediation
- Implement DOMPurify for HTML sanitization
- Add Content Security Policy headers
- Escape all user output
- Validate and sanitize AI responses

### 5. Excessive Console Logging in Production
**Severity: MEDIUM (CVSSv3: 5.3)**

#### Description
Found 131 console.log/error/warn statements across 31 files. Sensitive information may be logged:

```typescript
console.log('[Session API] Setting auth cookie...', {
  tokenLength: token.length  // Could expose token patterns
})
```

#### Impact
- Information disclosure in production logs
- Debugging information exposure
- Performance degradation

#### Remediation
- Remove debug logging in production builds
- Implement proper logging framework
- Sanitize log outputs

### 6. TypeScript Security Configuration
**Severity: MEDIUM (CVSSv3: 4.9)**

#### Description
TypeScript strict mode is disabled (`strict: false`) and build errors are ignored:

```javascript
typescript: {
  ignoreBuildErrors: true,
},
eslint: {
  ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
}
```

#### Impact
- Potential runtime type errors
- Reduced code quality
- Hidden security issues

#### Remediation
- Enable TypeScript strict mode
- Fix all type errors
- Enable build-time error checking

---

## üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 7. CSRF Token Implementation Issues
**Severity: MEDIUM (CVSSv3: 5.4)**

#### Description
CSRF protection implementation has potential bypass conditions:
- Skips CSRF for GET/HEAD requests (correct)
- Falls back to body parsing if header missing
- May be vulnerable to content-type confusion

#### Remediation
- Strengthen CSRF token validation
- Remove body fallback method
- Require header-based tokens only

### 8. Firebase Configuration Exposure
**Severity: LOW (CVSSv3: 3.1)**

#### Description
Firebase client configuration is exposed in `next.config.js` env section, though this is technically acceptable for Firebase client-side config.

#### Remediation
- Review if all exposed config is necessary
- Implement Firebase App Check for additional security

## AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION REVIEW

### Current Implementation
‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- HTTP-only cookies for session management
- CSRF protection implementation
- Secure cookie attributes in production
- Edge runtime middleware for route protection

‚ùå **Weaknesses:**
- Inconsistent token verification between environments
- Weak development mode authentication
- No role-based access control (RBAC)
- Missing session timeout handling

### Recommendations
1. Implement consistent authentication across all environments
2. Add role-based access control
3. Implement session timeout and refresh
4. Add rate limiting for authentication attempts

---

## API SECURITY ASSESSMENT

### Vulnerabilities Found
1. **Missing Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting on AI endpoints
2. **Insufficient Input Validation**: Basic Zod validation only
3. **Error Information Disclosure**: Detailed error messages in responses
4. **Missing Request Size Limits**: No body size restrictions

### Security Headers Missing
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options (partial implementation)
- Strict-Transport-Security
- Referrer-Policy

---

## DEPENDENCY SECURITY

### Outdated Dependencies
- React 19.0.0-rc.1 (release candidate, not stable)
- Multiple dependencies may have known vulnerabilities

### Recommendations
- Run `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Update to stable React version
- Implement automated dependency scanning

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Priority 1 (Do NOW)
1. **Revoke all exposed API keys immediately**
2. **Remove sensitive data from git history**
3. **Update .gitignore to prevent future exposure**
4. **Implement proper secret management**

### Priority 2 (This Week)
1. **Fix authentication vulnerabilities**
2. **Implement input sanitization**
3. **Add security headers**
4. **Remove debug logging**

### Priority 3 (Next Sprint)
1. **Add rate limiting**
2. **Implement RBAC**
3. **Add security monitoring**
4. **Security testing automation**

---

## COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### GDPR Implications
- User data processing without proper security controls
- Potential data breach notification requirements
- Need for data protection impact assessment

### Industry Standards
- Does not meet OWASP security standards
- Fails basic security best practices
- Requires security audit before production deployment

---

## SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### Code-Level Changes
```typescript
// 1. Implement proper input sanitization
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);

// 2. Add security headers
export async function headers() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/:path*',
      headers: [
        {
          key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
          value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
        },
        {
          key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
          value: 'nosniff'
        },
        {
          key: 'X-Frame-Options',
          value: 'DENY'
        }
      ]
    }
  ];
}

// 3. Implement rate limiting
const rateLimit = {
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
};
```

### Infrastructure Changes
1. **Secret Management**: Use Vercel environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager
2. **Monitoring**: Implement security logging and alerting
3. **Backup**: Secure backup strategy for sensitive data
4. **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege for all services
