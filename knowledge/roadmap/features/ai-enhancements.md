**Implementation**:
```typescript
// User-based rate limiting
const rateLimiter = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(20, "60 s"), // 20 requests per minute
  analytics: true,
})

// Cost budgeting
interface UserBudget {
  userId: string
  monthlyLimit: number
  currentSpend: number
  resetDate: Date
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Per-user rate limiting (20 req/min, 100 req/hour)
- [ ] Monthly cost budgets with alerts
- [ ] Graceful degradation when limits exceeded
- [ ] Admin dashboard for usage monitoring

#### 1.2 Request Caching System

**Objective**: Reduce API costs and improve response times

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Semantic caching with Redis
const cacheKey = `ai:categorize:${sha256(text)}:${provider}`
const ttl = 24 * 60 * 60 // 24 hours

// Cache similar requests
const similarity = await calculateSimilarity(text, cachedTexts)
if (similarity > 0.85) return cachedResponse
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Cache identical requests for 24 hours
- [ ] Semantic similarity matching (85% threshold)
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategies
- [ ] Cache hit rate monitoring (target: 30%+)

#### 1.3 Token Usage Tracking

**Objective**: Visibility into AI costs and usage patterns
